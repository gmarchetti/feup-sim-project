# SIR+S NetLogo Model

This projects contains the NetLogo implementation of the SIR+S model. It also includes some optional Jupyter notebooks used for data analyses regarding the FibVID dataset used for calibration.

## How-to install

To run the model, it is necessary to install the NetLogo framework, which can be found at

    https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/

## How-to run the model

 1. Import the file *diffusion-network-spread.nlogo* into the NetLogo installation.
 2. Adjust any parameter to the desired value. The model comes pre-configured with parameter values that resulted from the calibration process to match the behavior of the FibVID dataset.
 3. Click the Setup button.
 4. Click the Go button.

After clicking the *Go* button, the simulation should start. If no adjustment to the model's parameters are made, the simulation should run for 20 ticks. After 20 ticks, the simulation is reset and repeated 50 times.
